Enable the FIPS PPA repository, install the FIPS modules, configure
the bootloader and enable fips on the system. After successfully executing the
ubuntu-advantage script to enable fips, the system MUST be rebooted to
complete the enablement process. Failing to reboot will result in the system
not being fips enabled.
The \fItoken\fR argument must be in the form "user:password".

The following FIPS certified modules will be installed and put in fips mode;
openssh-server, openssh-client, strongswan, openssl, and the kernel
cryptoapi.

It's currently not possible to disable FIPS after it has been enabled.

.TP
.B
enable-fips-updates \fItoken\fR [\fB\-y\fR]
Updating the FIPS modules will take the system out of FIPS compliance as the
updated modules are not FIPS certified. The option enables the FIPS-UPDATES
PPA repository and installs the updated FIPS modules. If the system is
installing FIPS modules for the first time, it configures FIPS on the
system. After successfully executing the ubuntu-advantage script to
update FIPS modules, the system MUST be rebooted if FIPS kernel was
upgraded in the upgrade process. Failing to reboot will result
in the system not running the updated FIPS kernel.
The \fItoken\fR argument must be in the form "user:password".
The \fB\-y\fR argument is optional to bypass the user prompt while
installing updates.

The following FIPS modules will be updated and put in FIPS mode -
openssh-server, openssh-client, strongswan, openssl, and the kernel
cryptoapi.
